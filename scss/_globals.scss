/* 
Theme Rules
	Theme Rules arenâ€™t used as often within a project and because of
that I was quite reluctant to include them as their own category.
Some projects do have a need for them, though, as we did when
working on Yahoo! Mail.
	It is probably self-evident but a theme defines colours and images
that give your application or site its look and feel. Separating the
theme out into its own set of styles allows for those styles to be easily
redefined for alternate themes. The need for theming within a
project is necessary when you want the user to receive an alternate
skin that provides some cosmetic alterations.
	For example, your site may have different colours for different sections
of the site. Or you may allow users to customize the colour
based on a user preference. Or you may need to provide themes
based on locale such as country or language.
